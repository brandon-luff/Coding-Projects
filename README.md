# Project: Bike Owner Object

## Objective

To create a Python class that simulates a bicycle and its owner, encapsulating properties and behaviors for both.

### Skills Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  
- Class creation and initialization
  
- Encapsulation of properties and methods
  
- Handling user input
  
- List operations

### Tools Used

    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Python&logoColor=white" />
</div>

## Steps

- Defined the Bicycle class with properties: wheels, color, gears, and miles.

- Added methods to update and retrieve these properties, including adding miles and changing wheels.

- Defined the Owner class with properties: previous owners, list name, description, and current owner.

- Added methods to manage and display owner information, including adding previous owners and updating the current owner.

# Project: NHL Stats (No Longer Functions, API Links Changed)

## Objective

To create a Python script that retrieves and displays NHL player statistics using an API.

### Skills Learned

- API interaction using requests library
  
- JSON parsing
  
- User input handling
  
- Data retrieval and display
  
- Error handling

### Tools Used

<div>
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Visual%20Studio-5C2D91?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Visual%20Studio&logoColor=white" />
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Python&logoColor=white" />
</div>

## Steps

- Imported necessary libraries (requests, json).

- Defined a function to retrieve and display team roster information from the NHL API.

- Implemented another function to fetch and display specific player statistics.

- Handled user inputs to allow repeated queries for different players.

- Included error handling to manage API request issues and invalid inputs.
